    <h1>Bhavani Kongari presents a Greek play by Sophocles</h1>
    <h3>ANTIGONE - Sophocles</h3>
    <h4 class="WATCH">WATCH.</h4>
    <p class="speech WATCH">I cannot tell. There was no mark to show--
        No dint of spade, or mattock-loosened sod,--
        Only the hard bare ground, untilled and trackless.
        Whoe'er he was, the doer left no trace.
        And, when the scout of our first daylight watch
        Showed us the thing, we marvelled in dismay.
        The Prince was out of sight; not in a grave,
        But a thin dust was o'er him, as if thrown
        By one who shunned the dead man's curse. No sign
        Appeared of any hound or beast o' the field
        Having come near, or pulled at the dead body.
        Then rose high words among us sentinels
        With bickering noise accusing each his mate,
        And it seemed like to come to blows, with none
        To hinder. For the hand that thus had wrought
        Was any of ours, and none; the guilty man
        Escaped all knowledge. And we were prepared
        To lift hot iron with our bare palms; to walk
        Through fire, and swear by all the Gods at once
        That we were guiltless, ay, and ignorant
        Of who had plotted or performed this thing.
        When further search seemed bootless, at the last
        One spake, whose words bowed all our heads to the earth
        With fear. We knew not what to answer him,
        Nor how to do it and prosper. He advised
        So grave a matter must not be concealed,
        But instantly reported to the King.
        Well, this prevailed, and the lot fell on me,
        Unlucky man! to be the ministrant
        Of this fair service. So I am present here,
        Against my will and yours, I am sure of that.
        None love the bringer of unwelcome news.</p>

    <h4 class="CH">CH.</h4>
    <p class="speech CH">My lord, a thought keeps whispering in my breast,
        Some Power divine hath interposed in this.</p>

    <h4 class="CR">CR.</h4>
    <p class="speech CR">Cease, ere thou quite enrage me, and appear
        Foolish as thou art old. Talk not to me
        Of Gods who have taken thought for this dead man!
        Say, was it for his benefits to them
        They hid his corse, and honoured him so highly,
        Who came to set on fire their pillared shrines,
        With all the riches of their offerings,
        And to make nothing of their land and laws?
        Or, hast thou seen them honouring villany?
        That cannot be. Long time the cause of this
        Hath come to me in secret murmurings
        From malcontents of Thebes, who under yoke
        Turned restive, and would not accept my sway.
        Well know I, these have bribed the watchmen here
        To do this for some fee. For nought hath grown
        Current among mankind so mischievous
        As money. This brings cities to their fall:
        This drives men homeless, and moves honest minds
        To base contrivings. This hath taught mankind
        The use of wickedness, and how to give
        An impious turn to every kind of act.
        But whosoe'er hath done this for reward
        Hath found his way at length to punishment.
        If Zeus have still my worship, be assured
        Of that which here on oath I say to thee--
        Unless ye find the man who made this grave
        And bring him bodily before mine eye,
        Death shall not be enough, till ye have hung
        Alive for an example of your guilt,
        That henceforth in your rapine ye may know
        Whence gain is to be gotten, and may learn
        Pelf from all quarters is not to be loved.
        For in base getting, 'tis a common proof,
        More find disaster than deliverance.</p>
